# Phase 24: Rally & Reinforcements - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-08-24
**Status:** Ready for planning
**Source:** Pre-written during Phase 00. These decisions are locked — do not re-open them
in discussion. If one is genuinely unworkable, write an ADR and record it in
`docs/gsd/DECISIONS.md` rather than quietly designing around it.

## Phase Boundary

Alliance members combine armies into a single rally attack or reinforce each other's cities.

**Depends on:** Phase 23
**Milestone:** Multiplayer Alpha

This phase is complete when every success criterion in `.planning/ROADMAP.md`
(Phase 24) is demonstrably true. Those criteria are the contract; anything
beyond them is out of scope for this phase.

**Planned work** (from the roadmap — the planner may split further, not wider):

1. Rally entity, join window and army aggregation
2. Combined force resolution and proportional loss distribution
3. Reinforcement marches, garrison stacking and recall
4. Rally chat channel and coordination events
5. Mobile rally creation, join and tracking screens

## Implementation Decisions

### Rally mechanics
- A rally has a join window. Armies joining before it closes march as ONE combined force; late joiners are refused.
- Only alliance.start_rally may create one.
- Losses are distributed back to each contributing player PROPORTIONALLY and must reconcile exactly — test it as a conservation property, like plunder.
- Disbanding returns every contributed army to its owner without loss.

### Reinforcement
- Reinforcing troops defend the host city but remain OWNED by their sender and return home on recall. Ownership never transfers.
- Garrison stacking rules must be explicit about how reinforcements combine with the host's own troops in defence.

### Non-negotiables (apply to every phase)

These are enforced by tests. Breaking one fails the build, so do not work around them.

- **The server owns the truth.** The client sends intent; the server computes the
  outcome. Never accept a cost, duration, result or quantity from the client.
- **Time comes from the injected `Clock`.** Never `now()`, never a client timestamp.
- **Money is integer.** Use `ResourceAmount` / `ResourceBundle`. No float, ever.
- **Every gameplay query filters `world_id`.** Omitting it is a cross-world leak.
- **Spending resources means:** transaction → `lockForUpdate` → recompute cost
  server-side → re-check affordability *inside* the lock → mutate + write ledger.
- **Mutating commands accept `Idempotency-Key`** and are tested for double-submit.
- **Queued jobs that grant value are idempotent**, guarded on `completed_at IS NULL`.
- **Balance numbers live in `packages/game-data/`**, never in PHP.
- **New errors are added to the `ErrorCode` enum and to `openapi.yaml`** — never
  invented inline.
- **Broadcast channels deny by default** and both allow and deny paths are tested.

### Claude's Discretion
- File and class layout within the module, as long as the layering rule holds
  and layers are not created ceremonially (ADR-001).
- Test structure and naming, as long as the obligations in
  `.planning/codebase/TESTING.md` are covered.
- How work is split across plans.

## Specific Ideas

No additional product references beyond the success criteria and the decisions
above. Follow the documented design direction; do not imitate any existing game.

## Existing Code Insights

### Reusable assets
- `Game\Shared\Domain\Time\Clock` — inject for any time. `FrozenClock` in tests.
- `Game\Shared\Domain\Economy\ResourceAmount` / `ResourceBundle` — all economy maths.
- `Game\Shared\Application\Error\ErrorCode` / `GameException` — player-safe failures.
- `Game\Shared\Interface\Http\ApiResponse` — the only response envelope.
- `tests/Architecture/ArchitectureTest.php` — extend when this phase adds a boundary.

### Established patterns
- Modules live in `apps/api/modules/<Module>/` under the `Game\` namespace.
- Timed work = delayed job + idempotent completion + scheduled reconciler.
- Cross-module communication is domain events, never direct model access.

## Deferred Ideas

**Explicitly out of scope for this phase:**
- Diplomacy (Phase 26)

**Belongs to a later phase:**
- Rally against NPC world bosses — Phase 31
