# Phase 06: World Map Rendering - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-08-24
**Status:** Ready for planning
**Source:** Pre-written during Phase 00. These decisions are locked — do not re-open them
in discussion. If one is genuinely unworkable, write an ADR and record it in
`docs/gsd/DECISIONS.md` rather than quietly designing around it.

## Phase Boundary

A fluid, gesture-driven world map that stays at 60 FPS with thousands of entities on screen.

**Depends on:** Phase 05, Phase 02
**Milestone:** Playable Prototype

This phase is complete when every success criterion in `.planning/ROADMAP.md`
(Phase 06) is demonstrably true. Those criteria are the contract; anything
beyond them is out of scope for this phase.

**Planned work** (from the roadmap — the planner may split further, not wider):

1. Skia map canvas with pan, zoom and gesture handling
2. Viewport culling, level of detail and sprite batching
3. Tile fetching, client cache and delta application
4. Map markers, selection and the target detail sheet

## Implementation Decisions

### Rendering
- Skia canvas. NO React component per tile, marker or decoration — an architecture test enforces this. A component-per-entity map cannot hold 60 FPS.
- Draw in batches with a sprite atlas. Cull to viewport plus one screen of margin.
- Level of detail by zoom: markers simplify as you zoom out rather than every entity drawing at every zoom.

### Data and cache
- Fetch by chunk/region, cache in MMKV, apply deltas rather than refetching whole regions.
- TanStack Query owns fetched map data. Zustand owns only selection and camera state.

### Gestures
- Reanimated + Gesture Handler, running on the UI thread. Camera state must not round-trip through React state on every frame.
- Tap selects a tile and opens a bottom sheet showing the tile's true server-side contents — never a cached guess presented as fact.

### Non-negotiables (apply to every phase)

These are enforced by tests. Breaking one fails the build, so do not work around them.

- **The server owns the truth.** The client sends intent; the server computes the
  outcome. Never accept a cost, duration, result or quantity from the client.
- **Time comes from the injected `Clock`.** Never `now()`, never a client timestamp.
- **Money is integer.** Use `ResourceAmount` / `ResourceBundle`. No float, ever.
- **Every gameplay query filters `world_id`.** Omitting it is a cross-world leak.
- **Spending resources means:** transaction → `lockForUpdate` → recompute cost
  server-side → re-check affordability *inside* the lock → mutate + write ledger.
- **Mutating commands accept `Idempotency-Key`** and are tested for double-submit.
- **Queued jobs that grant value are idempotent**, guarded on `completed_at IS NULL`.
- **Balance numbers live in `packages/game-data/`**, never in PHP.
- **New errors are added to the `ErrorCode` enum and to `openapi.yaml`** — never
  invented inline.
- **Broadcast channels deny by default** and both allow and deny paths are tested.

### Claude's Discretion
- File and class layout within the module, as long as the layering rule holds
  and layers are not created ceremonially (ADR-001).
- Test structure and naming, as long as the obligations in
  `.planning/codebase/TESTING.md` are covered.
- How work is split across plans.

## Specific Ideas

No additional product references beyond the success criteria and the decisions
above. Follow the documented design direction; do not imitate any existing game.

## Existing Code Insights

### Reusable assets
- `Game\Shared\Domain\Time\Clock` — inject for any time. `FrozenClock` in tests.
- `Game\Shared\Domain\Economy\ResourceAmount` / `ResourceBundle` — all economy maths.
- `Game\Shared\Application\Error\ErrorCode` / `GameException` — player-safe failures.
- `Game\Shared\Interface\Http\ApiResponse` — the only response envelope.
- `tests/Architecture/ArchitectureTest.php` — extend when this phase adds a boundary.

### Established patterns
- Modules live in `apps/api/modules/<Module>/` under the `Game\` namespace.
- Timed work = delayed job + idempotent completion + scheduled reconciler.
- Cross-module communication is domain events, never direct model access.

## Deferred Ideas

**Explicitly out of scope for this phase:**
- Territory overlays (Phase 21/23)
- March path animation (Phase 15)
- Battle replay (Phase 18)

**Belongs to a later phase:**
- Map accessibility and hit-target audit — Phase 41
- Particle effects — Phase 44
