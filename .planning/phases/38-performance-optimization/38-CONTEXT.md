# Phase 38: Performance Optimization - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-08-24
**Status:** Ready for planning
**Source:** Pre-written during Phase 00. These decisions are locked — do not re-open them
in discussion. If one is genuinely unworkable, write an ADR and record it in
`docs/gsd/DECISIONS.md` rather than quietly designing around it.

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

The game meets its stated performance budget on both server and device, measured rather than asserted.

**Depends on:** Phase 37
**Milestone:** Beta

This phase is complete when every success criterion in `.planning/ROADMAP.md`
(Phase 38) is demonstrably true. Those criteria are the contract; anything
beyond them is out of scope for this phase.

**Planned work** (from the roadmap — the planner may split further, not wider):

1. Query profiling, index tuning and N+1 elimination
2. Cache strategy for read-heavy endpoints
3. Mobile render profiling and re-render elimination
4. Asset loading, bundle size and startup budget

<decisions>
## Implementation Decisions

### Measure, then optimise
- No endpoint may issue an N+1. Assert QUERY COUNTS on the heaviest endpoints — a count assertion catches regressions that a latency assertion misses.
- Meet the documented p95 budgets for world viewport, city state and rankings against a seeded LARGE dataset, not a toy one.
- Mobile: cold start to interactive city screen within budget on a mid-range device; map holds 60 FPS at the documented worst-case entity count.

### Caching
- Cache only derived, recomputable data. Redis is never authoritative (ADR-005). Every cached read needs an explicit invalidation design.

### Non-negotiables (apply to every phase)

These are enforced by tests. Breaking one fails the build, so do not work around them.

- **The server owns the truth.** The client sends intent; the server computes the
  outcome. Never accept a cost, duration, result or quantity from the client.
- **Time comes from the injected `Clock`.** Never `now()`, never a client timestamp.
- **Money is integer.** Use `ResourceAmount` / `ResourceBundle`. No float, ever.
- **Every gameplay query filters `world_id`.** Omitting it is a cross-world leak.
- **Spending resources means:** transaction → `lockForUpdate` → recompute cost
  server-side → re-check affordability *inside* the lock → mutate + write ledger.
- **Mutating commands accept `Idempotency-Key`** and are tested for double-submit.
- **Queued jobs that grant value are idempotent**, guarded on `completed_at IS NULL`.
- **Balance numbers live in `packages/game-data/`**, never in PHP.
- **New errors are added to the `ErrorCode` enum and to `openapi.yaml`** — never
  invented inline.
- **Broadcast channels deny by default** and both allow and deny paths are tested.

### Claude's Discretion
- File and class layout within the module, as long as the layering rule holds
  and layers are not created ceremonially (ADR-001).
- Test structure and naming, as long as the obligations in
  `.planning/codebase/TESTING.md` are covered.
- How work is split across plans.

## Specific Ideas

No additional product references beyond the success criteria and the decisions
above. Follow the documented design direction; do not imitate any existing game.

## Existing Code Insights

### Reusable assets
- `Game\Shared\Domain\Time\Clock` — inject for any time. `FrozenClock` in tests.
- `Game\Shared\Domain\Economy\ResourceAmount` / `ResourceBundle` — all economy maths.
- `Game\Shared\Application\Error\ErrorCode` / `GameException` — player-safe failures.
- `Game\Shared\Interface\Http\ApiResponse` — the only response envelope.
- `tests/Architecture/ArchitectureTest.php` — extend when this phase adds a boundary.

### Established patterns
- Modules live in `apps/api/modules/<Module>/` under the `Game\` namespace.
- Timed work = delayed job + idempotent completion + scheduled reconciler.
- Cross-module communication is domain events, never direct model access.

## Deferred Ideas

**Explicitly out of scope for this phase:**
- Horizontal scaling infrastructure (Phase 50)

**Belongs to a later phase:**
- Read replicas — only if measurement justifies
