# Phase 05: World Architecture - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-08-24
**Status:** Ready for planning
**Source:** Pre-written during Phase 00. These decisions are locked — do not re-open them
in discussion. If one is genuinely unworkable, write an ADR and record it in
`docs/gsd/DECISIONS.md` rather than quietly designing around it.

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

A persistent, queryable world of regions and tiles that the client can read a viewport of without ever loading the whole map.

**Depends on:** Phase 01
**Milestone:** Playable Prototype

This phase is complete when every success criterion in `.planning/ROADMAP.md`
(Phase 05) is demonstrably true. Those criteria are the contract; anything
beyond them is out of scope for this phase.

**Planned work** (from the roadmap — the planner may split further, not wider):

1. World, region and tile schema with PostGIS geometry
2. Deterministic world generation from a seed
3. Viewport and chunk query API with bounds validation
4. Spatial indexing and query performance benchmarks

## Implementation Decisions

### Coordinates
- Tiles use plain integer (world_id, x, y) with unique(world_id, x, y). Integers, not PostGIS points — exact, cheap, and the natural key for a grid.
- PostGIS geometry is used only where the shape is genuinely polygonal: region and territory boundaries, with GiST indexes.
- Square grid, not hex. Distance is Chebyshev-or-Euclidean per docs/game-design/world.md — pick one, document it, never mix.

### Deterministic generation
- World generation is seeded and pure: the same seed must produce byte-identical terrain. Test it.
- Generation runs as a command, not on request. A world is generated once at creation.
- Generation parameters (region size, terrain distribution, node density) come from packages/game-data, not code.

### Viewport queries
- Bounded server-side by config game.limits.world_viewport_max_tiles. A larger request returns VALIDATION_FAILED — do not silently clamp, that hides client bugs.
- Return only tiles inside the bounds. The client never receives the whole map.
- Prove the spatial/composite index is used with an EXPLAIN assertion in a test. This test runs against Postgres in CI, not SQLite.

### Non-negotiables (apply to every phase)

These are enforced by tests. Breaking one fails the build, so do not work around them.

- **The server owns the truth.** The client sends intent; the server computes the
  outcome. Never accept a cost, duration, result or quantity from the client.
- **Time comes from the injected `Clock`.** Never `now()`, never a client timestamp.
- **Money is integer.** Use `ResourceAmount` / `ResourceBundle`. No float, ever.
- **Every gameplay query filters `world_id`.** Omitting it is a cross-world leak.
- **Spending resources means:** transaction → `lockForUpdate` → recompute cost
  server-side → re-check affordability *inside* the lock → mutate + write ledger.
- **Mutating commands accept `Idempotency-Key`** and are tested for double-submit.
- **Queued jobs that grant value are idempotent**, guarded on `completed_at IS NULL`.
- **Balance numbers live in `packages/game-data/`**, never in PHP.
- **New errors are added to the `ErrorCode` enum and to `openapi.yaml`** — never
  invented inline.
- **Broadcast channels deny by default** and both allow and deny paths are tested.

### Claude's Discretion
- File and class layout within the module, as long as the layering rule holds
  and layers are not created ceremonially (ADR-001).
- Test structure and naming, as long as the obligations in
  `.planning/codebase/TESTING.md` are covered.
- How work is split across plans.

No additional product references beyond the success criteria and the decisions
above. Follow the documented design direction; do not imitate any existing game.

## Existing Code Insights

### Reusable assets
- `Game\Shared\Domain\Time\Clock` — inject for any time. `FrozenClock` in tests.
- `Game\Shared\Domain\Economy\ResourceAmount` / `ResourceBundle` — all economy maths.
- `Game\Shared\Application\Error\ErrorCode` / `GameException` — player-safe failures.
- `Game\Shared\Interface\Http\ApiResponse` — the only response envelope.
- `tests/Architecture/ArchitectureTest.php` — extend when this phase adds a boundary.

### Established patterns
- Modules live in `apps/api/modules/<Module>/` under the `Game\` namespace.
- Timed work = delayed job + idempotent completion + scheduled reconciler.
- Cross-module communication is domain events, never direct model access.

## Deferred Ideas

**Explicitly out of scope for this phase:**
- Rendering (Phase 06)
- Cities on tiles (Phase 07)
- NPC camps and nodes (Phase 16)
- Territory ownership (Phase 21)

**Belongs to a later phase:**
- Database partitioning by world_id — Phase 38 if measurement justifies
- Read replicas — Phase 38
